# The Problem
   Appalachia Service Project (ASP) is a non-profit with a mission to eradicate substandard housing in Central Appalachia. Each summer they employ college-aged adults to run about 28 centers in five states. In teams of four, the staffs have to conduct initial home visits to assess homes, and choose projects based on time, volunteer skill and budget. The problem the managers have noticed over the years is the ability for the staffs to choose projects that fit within their budget is a difficult skill to learn during their short employment. 

# The Solution
   A web application that will help the staff with project cost estimation, projected project duration, budget tracking, and material lists. The application will generate estimations as well as educate the staff on factors that greatly affect project costs. 

# The Application
The home view is the budget detail view
- Shows projected budget
- Shows actual budget
- Shows number of work crews per week - this field is editable in case groups add a work crew or one crew drops out
- Shows projects, both active and inactive
