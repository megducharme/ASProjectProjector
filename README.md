# The Problem
   Appalachia Service Project (ASP) is a non-profit with a mission to eradicate substandard housing in Central Appalachia. Each summer they employ college-aged adults to run about 28 centers in five states. In teams of four, the staffs have to conduct initial home visits to assess homes, and choose projects based on time, volunteer skill and budget. Managers have realized that the skill to choose projects that fit within the staff's budget is a difficult to learn during their short employment. 

# The Solution
   A web application that will help the staff with project cost estimation, projected project duration, budget tracking, and material and tool lists. The application will generate estimations as well as educate the staff on factors that greatly affect project costs.
